# Spell-Check is a matter of Context

- Technical Docs
- Source Code
- Literary Material

Imagine a document which served an audience from an academic stand-point. Spell checking on such a work would need to be top-notch. However, in a technical whitepaper, it's entirely possible that the audience scrutinizes the spelling less or that certain jargon is used which does not conform to proper spelling. Going further, source code would not survive a spell-check process at all.

Missspellings.
